	<description>There are moments in RimWorld when your colonists stand in the snow, rifles slung over their shoulders, watching the horizon for raiders. It already feels mythic. It just needed the right music.
	
This mod brings selections from Skyrim - The Original Game Soundtrack into your RimWorld experience — carefully integrated, not lazily dumped into a playlist. Every track has been placed with intent.

The original score, composed by Jeremy Soule, carries that old Nordic, windswept, end-of-the-world energy. On paper, medieval tundra choirs and a sci-fi crash-landing colony shouldn’t mix. In practice? It feels like your colonists are writing a saga on the edge of a forgotten planet.

What this mod does:
• Calm, ambient tracks rotate during peaceful daytime colony management.
• Colder, atmospheric pieces surface in winter and harsh biomes.
• Subtle night themes create a sense of isolation under alien skies.
• Combat and raid events trigger intense, driving tracks.
• Large-scale threats and desperate defenses escalate the music appropriately.

The result is emotional continuity. When a raid hits at dusk during a snowstorm, the score swells like the final act of a legend. When your colony survives against impossible odds, it sounds earned.

This isn’t just background music. It reframes the narrative of your colony. RimWorld is already a story generator — this mod gives it an epic memory.

Perfect for players who:
• Lean into dramatic storytelling.
• Build harsh tundra or tribal colonies.
• Love emergent narrative.
• Want their space frontier to feel ancient and mythic.

Install it. Let your crash-landed survivors feel less like random pawns…and more like the founders of a saga future historians will sing about.

Because sometimes the edge of space feels a lot like the edge of Tamriel.
